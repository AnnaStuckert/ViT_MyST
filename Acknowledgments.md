# Acknowledgments 🫡

This repository is based on the [ViT-pytorch repository](https://github.com/jeonsworld/ViT-pytorch) by [jeonsworld](https://github.com/jeonsworld). Their work on implementing Vision Transformers in PyTorch provided a valuable foundation for this project. 

Additionally, for the implementation of attention maps based on key points (KPs), we have adapted methods from the [vit-explain repository](https://github.com/jacobgil/vit-explain) by [jacobgil](https://github.com/jacobgil).
